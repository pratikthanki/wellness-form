Wellness Form
=============

The Wellness Form allows for easy entry of wellness data point on web and mobile. 
The data is written to a database for analysis. 

This uses the [JSON Form](http://github.com/joshfire/jsonform/) library 


Dependencies
------------

The JSON Form library depends on:
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) utility belt

NB: JSON Form also uses ```JSON.parse``` and ```JSON.stringify``` which is normally already natively supported by all modern browsers.
